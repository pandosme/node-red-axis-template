# node-red-contrib-axis-template

A template that can be used to build Axis specific nodes.  Users must install [node-red-contrib-axis-com](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-axis-com) as it contains the Axis Device Node that the template depends on.

After forking this repository, replace all occurance of "Axis Template" in axis-template.html, axis-template.js and package.json to some descriptive name (whatever the node is intended for).
